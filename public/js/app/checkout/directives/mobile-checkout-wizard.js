/**
 * mobile-checkout-wizard
 *
 * This directive includes a checkout wizard for the mobile checkout process, which requires that information
 * is filled out in segments ("steps"), and all subsequent steps are blocked from input until the required
 * information has been provided for previous steps. If the user edits a previously completed step, all subsequent steps
 * are marked "undone" again, and the user has to tab through the remaining steps to advance.  Validation of
 * required fields comes into play as the user attempts to advance to the next.  If there are missing fields,
 * the missing fields will be highlighted as errors, and the user cannot advance until the necessary information
 * has been provided.
